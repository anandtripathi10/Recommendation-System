It is a compact convertible.Don't expect a big trunk or having tall people in the back seat.,4.5
1, on 07/07/10 05:28 AM (PDT),carlo frazzano ,2007 Volkswagen New Beetle Convertible 2.5 PZEV 2dr Convertible (2.5L 5cyl 6A),Quality Review, We bought the car new in 2007 and are generally satisfied. Mechanically the car has been good but build quality needs improvement except for the paint job which is the best I have ever seen.  Problems we have had are: 1. Three headlight bulbs replaced. 2. Entire locking mechanism for power convertible top had to be replaced. 3. Coolant temperature switch replaced. 4. Four trunk pistons failed with the fifth now broken. 5. Seat belt retainer bezel broken off and replaced.  Fuel mileage is average that is 25 around town - less if air running and about 30 mpg at 65 mph if air not running.  Trunk space is inadequate and simple repair under the hood is difficult and expensive.,4.375
2, on 10/19/09 21:41 PM (PDT),NewBeetleDriver ,2007 Volkswagen New Beetle Convertible Triple White PZEV 2dr Convertible (2.5L 5cyl 6A),Adore it," I adore my New Beetle. Even though I'm a male, I get compliments from my other guy friends, especially after they've driven it. Convertible a must! The only problem I've had was the wiring harness shorted. Fortunately, the car is still under warranty, and will be back to running soon!",4.375
3, on 01/01/09 19:13 PM (PST),Kayemtee ,2007 Volkswagen New Beetle Convertible 2.5 2dr Convertible (2.5L 5cyl 5M),Nice Ragtop," My wife chose this car to replace a Sebring convertible.  Wanted a clutch again before we got too old.  Performance is adequate at best; acceleration reminds me of my old bugs of my youth.  Clutch is not as smooth as Japanese cars.  Great head and leg room (I'm six-two).  Very quiet with top up at high speeds (much less wind noise than the Sebring).  Heated seats (with five settings) are great!  Gas mileage is poor (24 mpg) for a small car with a clutch with weak acceleration.  Nice, solid build quality, pretty looking, but it is a chick car.  Oil change is very expensive due to synthetic only and a non-standard filter.  Trunk holds a lot but small opening.  I like the car but glad we lease.",4.375

Backseat ok for normal size.  Gas mileage could be better but luv, luv my dream car.  Someone is always commenting about it as I did for many years b4 I bought it. Coworkers are happy I finally bought it because they were probably tired of me talking about it for about 5 yrs. I don't have a garage, unfortunately, but it is great in the snow.  Haven't had any problems to date.  Love to go riding on beautiful days with the top down.",4.75
5, on 05/16/08 12:07 PM (PDT),Ray Cavanagh ,2007 Volkswagen New Beetle Convertible Triple White PZEV 2dr Convertible (2.5L 5cyl 6A),The Best One So Far....," I owned a 2002 SLK and 2003 BMW Z-4.  After spending a fortune for upkeep of these two cars I dumped them both and bought a 2007 Convertible, and a 2008 Triple White coupe.  They both run circles around my former car.  I have homes in both Sacramento and Palm Springs, a ride of 500 miles.  Both cars get me there in style and comfort.  So far, I have been happy with both.  The comfort level and handling has been outstanding.  Love the fact that I am putting regular gas in and not the premium I was so use to.  I will never do the luxury car route again when I can get a better car in the New Bug.",5
6, on 03/28/08 22:04 PM (PDT),harvestmoon ,2007 Volkswagen New Beetle Convertible 2.5 2dr Convertible (2.5L 5cyl 6A),Don't Fall Under The Cute Spell!," Fell in love with the car's look and would be a happy camper if it weren't for all of the little hiccups the car had. I owned this car for 6 months. In those 6 months the top stopped working, the door locks and the cd player malfunctioned, the inside started rattling and squeaking, and the gas gauge broke. This was a 2007 NBC! If you are thinking about buying this car, please keep looking. Maybe a mini? Believe me when I say HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! If you already own one...good luck!",2.75
7, on 01/03/08 17:53 PM (PST),The Husband ,2007 Volkswagen New Beetle Convertible Triple White 2dr Convertible (2.5L 5cyl 6A),Not for Cold Weather!!!," The car is beautiful and performs well in the warm weather.  It is much better on fuel than my Jeep Wrangler.  It really makes my wife happy and I like that.  The problem is that the windows have to open (when the handle is pulled) to open the door.  If it gets below 20 degrees, the windows won't open. That means that you can't get in, and if you finally do, you can't close the door or the glass will break. Because of the security VW voids the warranty if you install an aftermarket remote starter and they do not offer one.",3.75
8, on 09/27/07 08:42 AM (PDT),Kristina ,2007 Volkswagen New Beetle Convertible 2.5 2dr Convertible (2.5L 5cyl 6A),I love my Beetle," I love my car.  I previously owned an Explorer, and the two are difficult to compare.  The only thing I miss about my Explorer is the storage space, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much can fit in a Beetle.  I don't understand why people complain about the gas mileage, I think it's great but then my Explorer did have a V8 engine.  Beetles are fun cars to drive, the sound system is great, and it works perfectly as a commuter car.",5

I totally love it.  It is fun, reliable and has enough pep for me.  I was surprised by the amount of room in the trunk, as I expected virtually nothing.  Just really really pleased. I do miss a change holder, as there is no easy place to put a few dollars.",5

The ABS braking system and anti-skid functions seem to work well.  I had several opportunities to drive it in the snow this year, and it seemed to handle that challenge quite well.   Though it presents some restrictions, I do appreciate the Bug's styling, as it sets it apart from other cars its size, ",4.375

So?  We should expect more for the more money we pay.  How about power seats (sit higher, too), locks, mirrors, a better stereo (MP4), free DVD navigation, cool electronics?  Eliminate the pillar and rear blind spots.  Give it a better trunk lock.  How about the top receding into the boot with an automatic tonneau cover or an power hard top?  Give it more power.  The handling needs work.  It has a firm ride, cut the sponginess.  Hey, give it better gas mileage, please!  Also, give us attractive mirrors.",3

16, on 02/15/16 16:53 PM (PST),Myra ,2007 Volkswagen New Beetle Hatchback 2.5 2dr Hatchback (2.5L 5cyl 5M),LOVE THE LEMON!," I purchased my 2007 baby in 2010, Houston Tx and it was shipped from Florida.  Very good vehicle, performance, reliability, got caught in 2 floods water middle ways my tires and I made it through, no hesitation no problems afterwards, wonderful!  I love the air tight, heavy doors!  When shipped a lot of repairs had to be done to get it ready. But the factory warranty covered everything accept the $100 per pop!  After the factory warranty ended I purchased extended warranty that covered other repairs, but for about 1 1/2 years, because the value of my car is only $5,000, the extended warranty no longer covers, it's all on me and it has been a very expensive 2 years, seems like everything is falling apart.  And because some parts takes a long to get here, I have also paid much in rental cars. A matter of fact it's in the shop as I speak, ignition housing went out and has to be re-keyed etc., gone take 8-15 days before part arrives, go figure the cost of this rental for 15 days!  I think it may be time to move on!",4

That car was GREAT. It gave me very few problems, and it never left me stranded. One of the worse mistakes I have made. I've had lots of stupid problems come up. I bought the car with 68k miles, and all service records. I had no warning and the water pump went out, at 68.5k. Replaced two wheel bearings, the tie rods, the door speaker. I could go on. I have had this car a little over a year. The best part was when the inner axle snapped getting off the highway. I think my car must be a lemon. It is getting harder and harder to justify keeping it.My car looks great, but it doesn't perform half as well as my 2000 did, which had twice the miles.",3.125
18, on 10/25/11 22:36 PM (PDT),birulo ,2007 Volkswagen New Beetle Hatchback 2.5 2dr Hatchback (2.5L 5cyl 6A),in love with my Beetle," Bought this car new from the dealer and it's given me a couple of problems but overall I don't regret the purchase. Its sole appearance makes me happy every time I look at it. I seriously love my car.My only complain is that the parts, oil changes and even the coolant are very expensive. To be objective, I have to mention that entering its 4th year (2011), little things here and there started to break down, for example the interior roof liner is coming loose on the edges, antenna broke when covered the car with an ordinary car cover and one of the windshield washers seems to be clogged. My compressor died this year too ($2000)... and the battery and the headlights but that's to be expected",4.875

But in september an ignition coil went out., Then in march 2 more went within 2 weeks of each other. Now less than 4 weeks later another one has just gone out. The only thing saving me from driving this car off a cliff, besides the repairs being covered under warranty, is the fact there is only 1 ignition coil left to go out. And VW wont replace it until it fails. I just hope it doesnt happen late at nite or when im on my way to an interview. I just dont need this aggrevation, but since I dont have a job I cant go trade this in. Hopefully the 5th coil will go out soon and I can stop worrying...",4.625
20, on 01/15/10 10:09 AM (PST),Curie ,2007 Volkswagen New Beetle Hatchback 2.5 2dr Hatchback (2.5L 5cyl 6A),Sadly Disappointed," Having driven a classic Beetle as a teenager, this car was a major disappointment.  Three months after buying the car, the fuel pump relay died leaving me stranded at 10:00 pm.  Three years after buying the car, I traded it in for a 2010 Honda Fit. The lights and radio wouldn't work when it was cold. The heater wouldn't work when the car was idling. The driver's headlight had to be replaced due to ""faulty wiring"". Upon acceleration or deceleration, the car would often hesitate. After a snow storm, snow would often get trapped in the wheel well causing the car to shake at speeds above 40 mph. Living in Nebraska, it's important to have a reliable car.",3.25

Good performance, but the handling could be a little tighter. MPG is constantly around the 30 mark. I have 40000 miles on it and it has not given me any trouble. There were a couple of squeaks/rattles at the beginning but they have since vanished. I would recommend this car from my personal experience. Happy Motoring.",4.5
23, on 08/15/09 09:35 AM (PDT),nlinldsey ,2007 Volkswagen New Beetle Hatchback 2.5 2dr Hatchback (2.5L 5cyl 6A),Love it!," This was my 2nd Beetle and I absolutely love this car! I recently sold mine since my family needs space. The car is very sturdy and well-built. I was impressed with how well it handled in stormy weather on the interstate. I also loved the space once the back seat folds down. It was spacious enough for my 75 pound Lab in her cage. I never experienced mechanical problems with it. My only complaint was the oil change would cost me $70 or more. This car requires Synthetic oil, which is more expensive than regular oil. ",5

I got 24 to 30 MPG on the trip driving at an average speed of 75MPH on the interstate. I get 23 - 24 MPG driving around Phoenix on a daily basis.  I love the torque. It is hard not to spin the tires from a full stop. I get some strange looks from the Mustang owners when that happens. I am 6'3"" and have lots of head room but I had to remove the center arm rest to make room for my elbows. Now there is a big hole in the console but I'm comfortable. The road noise is the one thing I wish was better. Thankfully Phoenix put rubberized asphalt on all the freeways. It is very fun to drive. ",4.625

This Beetle is much peppier than the old 2004 - 4 cylinder engine.  Only drawback is when you drive fast you get 20 to 23 MPG in the city.  The heated seats are the best new feature.!  I wish the visors were wider or perhaps extended longer because they don't block side sun glare very well.  The comfort is great, and the room is great.  I have hauled a lot of stuff in this little car.  My only other request is to make this car a hybrid.  I have gotten 34 MPG highway using speed control.  I beat an Austin Mini Cooper in a drag race and matched a Corvette for the first 50 yards, so this car is FAST.!  Thanks VW for a car more fun than my 2004 New Beetle.!",4.75

I love this car. At first the look impressed me the most. I finally found a 5-speed, green model which was hard to come by. The way this car handles is great. It hugs the road and is the ultimate road-trip car. The fifth cylinder can really be felt on a steep incline and the cold-weather package has helped me through many a snowy morning! It handles in 6 inches of snow, no problem, and the sunroof makes the summer weather even better!

Too many trips to the service department, too many recalls, too many service lights coming on worrying me about even more problems.  I see likewise frustrated people at the service counter everytime I come in. I'm charged an arm and a leg every time, without a guarantee that the fix will work.  A 10 year old KIA has had no problems.  I got too excited about aesthetics of it.  But the features don't work and have to be repeatedly fixed.  If only I read more reviews of long-term owners.  Never another VW again.  They are nice when on the dealer lot, but in reality too much trouble.",2.875

This car is quite impressive all around.  I love this car.  It is comfortable, enjoyable, affordable, even if the gas mileage isn't stellar.  It sure beats my old 2006 PT Cruiser which was getting 17 mpg city.  You can't help but smile when driving the Beetle.  It sticks to the road and is very quick and I feel extremely safe in it even though it is a small car.  Don't over think and criticize the back seat.  It is more than enough.  So the head room isn't excessive, I have had 4 door sedans that were just as bad.  Enjoy the ride.",5

Despite the frustrations that come with being a VW owner, I keep coming back over and over. Why? The handling - the driving experience. There are so few cars on the market, in my opinion, that combine compactness and great handling. Having driven other compact makes, I find that the Beetle is heavier, handles better, has better features and more road presence. While other compacts feel like they are likely to get blown off the road in a high wind, the Beetle tends to clutch the road and hold its own in snow, rain, etc.",3.5

I was missing it terribly! Last month I bought a new 07, yellow this time. I'm so happy to have a Beetle again. It's easy to park, fun to drive, cleans up nicely and compared to my pick-up truck and Jaguar, economical to keep the tank full. These are cute little cars. I enjoyed my last one and still see it around town. (It's much loved and still looks great.) I know that if the day comes that I must part with this one, it will also find the right person to love it. In the 99 I don't miss the old cup holders or cloth/fabric seats.

I have been a Benz and Beemer girl for many years. I wanted a change, and found it with the Beetle. While I love luxury, I like simplicity. I like speed, but not Grand Prix MPH. I want comfort, but not so much that I do not know what to do with it. I love my new Beetle. It is roomier than my former BMW 325i. The trunk is bigger, but configured differently. It runs a little rougher than my old BMW, but we are talking a $20,000 car vs. a $40,000 car. You get what you pay for. The ease of driving and engineering of devices is so easy. BMW and Benz take brain power to figure it all out. VW is simple and, well, simple. The Beetle is comfy, fun, and costs much less money.  I love it!",5

40, on 03/19/14 21:27 PM (PDT),azuki ,2003 Volkswagen New Beetle Convertible GL 2dr Convertible (2.0L 4cyl 6A),My Horror Story," This was my first car at the age of 18. When I got my Beetle, it had about 72,000 miles on it, and not even 4 months after receiving it, the problems began. Immediately, my transmission died completely. My warranty company gave me a $4,000 check and voided my warranty after seeing the $12,000 repair bill. Then, the battery died. Twice. As did the alternator and air conditioning. My rear window also got stuck and that would have cost me 4 hours of labor fees just to get to the broken bits. It's not like I drove it a lot - over a course of 3 years I didn't even drive 10,000 miles. For the love of god, stay away from this car. It is one problem after another, literally every 3-5 months.Update:It has been two years since I got my new car. I have named it ""Not Beetle,"" and have had zero problems with it.

First 100 miles the waterpump failed and was replaced without any hassles. Second time was due to the city of Chicago not posting any hazard warning for street work, destroying the bottom oil pan at 40,000 miles.

It starts right up in cold weather (as low as -8 F), handles well, and has more than enough power.  The car is comfortable and has been dependable to date other than the repeated replacement of headlights (three in 65,000 miles).  The interior has held up well despite the miles and three kids.  I bought it as a leftover for $16,600 and it has proven to be very reliable.  My uncle owns an auto 2002 TDI and gets 42 mpg.  Mine is the 5-speed stick.

Yes and no.  It generally gets good gas mileage but there is a problem.  Our diesel fuel isn't all that good and the engine has a tendency to combine some of the bad components with carbon particles which, over time, ends up clogging the intake manifold.  There has been a solution (a rather expensive one) but VW no longer supports it.  You can get to about 30,000 - 40,000 miles before something has to be done.  Know this going in, if VW figures out a solution to this problem, the car is a great buy, if they don't stay away.  ",3.875
